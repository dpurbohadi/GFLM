**Gamma Feedback Learning Model (GFLM)**

The Gamma Feedback Learning Model (GFLM) describes a cyclic process that connects classroom learning, self-directed study, data collection, and evaluation through continuous feedback. It aims to enhance learner autonomy while maintaining instructor guidance and data-driven improvement.

**1. Classroom activity (Tutorial, face-to-face):**

The learning process begins with direct tutorials where key concepts are introduced and discussed. This stage provides a foundation and ensures conceptual understanding before independent study.

**2. Online/offline activity (Self-Directed Learning):**

Students continue learning independently using e-learning technologies. Assignments given during the tutorial are completed in this phase. Learners manage their own pace while applying knowledge from class sessions.

**3. Data collection (Activities and scores stored in LMS):**

All student activities and assessment results are stored in the Learning Management System (LMS). This data becomes the basis for monitoring progress and measuring learning outcomes objectively.

**4. Evaluation (Identifying learning problems):**

Collected data is analyzed to identify problems such as low motivation or misunderstanding of materials. The instructor uses these findings to provide corrective actions or reinforcement.

The feedback cycle connects all components:

- Assignments transfer learning tasks from classroom to self-study.
- Monitoring ensures progress is tracked continuously.
- Storing maintains all learning evidence within the LMS.
- Group and individual interventions are applied to address detected learning gaps, ensuring improvement before the next cycle begins.

In essence, GFLM emphasizes continuous feedback, personalized intervention, and the integration of digital learning environments to support both collaborative and self-regulated learning.
